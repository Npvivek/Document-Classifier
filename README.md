## **Folder Structure**
Ensure your file structure follows the format below for proper pipeline execution:

```
root_directory/
    â”œâ”€â”€ azure_files/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bill_of_lading/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ customs_document/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ delivery_receipt/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ invoice/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ... (other categories)
    â””â”€â”€ outputs/
        â”œâ”€â”€ classification_results.xlsx
        â”œâ”€â”€ confusion_matrix.png
```

## **Pipeline Workflow**

1. **Load Model and Processor**
   - Leverages the Qwen2-VL-2B-GPTQ-INT4 model for classification.

2. **PDF Conversion and Image Merging**
   - Converts multi-page PDFs into vertically stacked images for efficient processing.

3. **Custom Prompt Engineering**
   - Builds prompts with domain-specific patterns and keywords for better predictions.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Generates a confusion matrix and classification report.
   - Saves results in a color-coded Excel file.

5. **Visualization**
   - Visualize classification performance using heatmaps and other plots.

## **Results and Reporting**

### **Outputs Generated**
- **Classification Accuracy**: Per-category and overall model performance metrics.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Heatmap visualization of expected vs predicted classifications.
- **Excel Reports**: Color-coded Excel files with classification details.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- **OCR Integration**: Improve text extraction for better accuracy.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Incorporate additional labeled data.
- **Multilingual Support**: Expand capabilities to handle documents in multiple languages.
- **Advanced Models**: Explore LayoutLMv3 for complex layouts.
